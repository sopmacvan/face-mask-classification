# Face Mask Classification

Face mask detection has become an essential task in recent times, especially in the context of public health and safety.
In this project, we address the challenge of automatically predicting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not,
given an image of their face.

Through this project, we aim to build a robust and accurate model capable of identifying individuals wearing face masks,
which can have a wide range of applications, including in security systems, healthcare facilities, and public spaces.

The dataset that will be used for training, testing, and validation is
the ['Face Mask Detection ~12K Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset),'
comprising 12,000 images segregated into distinct directories.

## Main objective

Predict if a person is wearing a mask or not based on an input image of their face.
